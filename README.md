# IOProcess

## Why?

When performing IO over network storage (specifically NFS) the process might get stuck in D state.
To prevent you main process from becoming unkillable you might prefer to have a slave process do all the risky IO.
This is what ioprocess is for.


## Goals
- Small memory footprint per call.
- Extensible
- Easy integration with python and other languages.
